# Global-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Dataset
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:

Pivot Table Analysis:

Created pivot tables to analyze the average life expectancy by continent and year, utilizing Pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities.
Indexed by 'continent' and displayed 'year' as columns, summarizing the data by calculating the average 'life expectancy' (life_exp).
Percentile-based Filtering:

Performed advanced statistical analysis to identify countries with a GDP per capita higher than the 75th percentile in 2007.
Used Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to filter and extract relevant insights from the dataset.
Life Expectancy Categorization:

Created new features by categorizing 'life expectancy' (life_exp) into 4 equally ranged bins (Low, Medium, High, and Very High) using the cut() function in Pandas.
Added these categorical life expectancy groups as a new column, 'Life_Exp_Range', for enhanced segmentation and analysis.
Top 5 Countries with Highest GDP per Capita (2007):

Performed data sorting to identify the top 5 countries with the highest GDP per capita in 2007.
Created visually compelling horizontal bar charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to display the top-performing countries, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Cleaned, normalized, and prepared large datasets for analysis, handling missing values and inconsistencies efficiently.
Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas for data wrangling and data preprocessing to ensure high-quality data analysis.
